> Hey, all! This is a writeup to a vulnhub machine I solved recently, after it was suggested to me by thatsitamar.

> I have both machines set up on NAT, the ova runs and my attacker machine (Heavily configured Ubuntu, I'd say to better follow maybe do it on Kali or Parrot?)

> This, of course, is a general outline without detailed explanations& a lot (but a lot) of memes!
