## About Me

Hey! I am pwnstar, usually going under that name or as ```frobenius_endomorphism()```, a [Crypto](https://cryptoisnotcryptocurrency.com/) enthusiast with a bit too much free time and license to IDA pro.

A bit more about me!
I'm interested in:
- Mathematics
    - Category Theory
    - Elliptic curves
    - Galois Theory
    - Graph theory
    - Number theoretic functions
    - Optimization
- The ```Mandatory palestine``` era 
- Rust
- CTFs
    - Crypto (Mostly)
    - pwn 
    - Reverse engineering
- Genetics and systems biology
- Computer Science
    - Complexity Theory
    - Algorithms, mostly number theoretic
    - Systems Programming
- Vim
  - It is the IDE I use for $\LaTeX$ work
  - I use it for competitive programming too
- Linux
  - I use Arch as a main OS and I also run VMs of:
      - Ubuntu
      - Debian
      - Void
- Reading



I usually play CTFs on:
  - [Hackthebox](https://app.hackthebox.com)

  - [Websec.fr](https://websec.fr/)
  - [reversing.kr](https://reversing.kr/)
