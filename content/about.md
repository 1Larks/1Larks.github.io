## About Me

Hey! I am pwnstar, usually going under that name or as ```frobenius_endomorphism()```, a Crypto enthusiast with a bit too much free time and license to IDA pro.

A bit about me!
  - I love:
      - Cryptography
      - Galois theory
      - Elliptic curves
      - Rust
      - History
      - Low level research
