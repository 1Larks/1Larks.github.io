title: On writing $n$ as the product of $k$ Distinct positive integers
categories: [Math, PET, Project Euler]
---

> Let $W(n, k)$ denote the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as the product of $k$ integers. For example, $W(144, 4) = 7$ because:

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 8 \times 9$

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 24$

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 6 \times 12$

> $144 = 1 \times 3 \times 4 \times 12$

> $144 = 1 \times 3 \times 6 \times 8$

> $144 = 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6$

> Furthermore, $W(100!,10)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007 = 287549200$. 

> Find $W(10000!,30)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

If you got to this problem, you probably know that you should *not* share solutions after the first 100 problems, and I am not going to violate it. This blog post is supposed to be a general outline to how I solved it, and hopefullym, after reading it you will also be able to.

Also, this was written while I solved, so you'll prob notice deleted papers and comments. So, let's start.

What did I learn from this problem? 

- Burnside's lemma

- Polya's enumeraetion theorem

- Inclusion exclusion

- Advanced> generating functions 

Cool. Resources will be found below!

Starting, my general thought was "My computer is rather strong. I believe I can bruteforce it". It does not work. (Or does it? Dm me)

- Frobenius form of a diophantine equation

A diophantine equation is said to be in a ```Diophantine form``` if it looks like:

$$\sum_{i=1}^k a_i x_i = n$$
