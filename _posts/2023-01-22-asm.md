title: On writing $n$ as the product of $k$ Distinct positive integers
categories: [Math, PET, Project Euler]

> Let $W(n, k)$ denote the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as the product of $k$ integers. For example, $W(144, 4) = 7$ because:

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 8 \times 9$

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 24$

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 6 \times 12$

> $144 = 1 \times 3 \times 4 \times 12$

> $144 = 1 \times 3 \times 6 \times 8$

> $144 = 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6$

> Furthermore, $W(100!,10)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007 = 287549200$. 

> Find $W(10000!,30)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

If you got to this problem, you probably know that you should *not* share solutions after the first 100 problems, and I am not going to violate it. This blog post is supposed to be a general outline to how I solved it, and hopefullym, after reading it you will also be able to.

Also, this was written while I solved, so you'll prob notice deleted papers and comments. So, let's start.

What did I learn from this problem? 

- Burnside's lemma

- Polya's enumeration theorem

- Inclusion exclusion

- Advanced> generating functions 

Cool. Resources will be found below!

Starting, my general thought was "My computer is rather strong. I believe I can bruteforce it". It does not work. (Or does it? Dm me)

# Frobenius form of a diophantine equation

A diophantine equation is said to be in a ```Frobenius form``` if it looks like:

$$\sum_{i=1}^k a_i x_i = n$$

Ok. Admittedly, this is not my niche in math, but luckily it has already been [asked](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1182231/amount-of-solutions-to-the-diophantine-equation-of-frobenius) on Math stack exchange, yay?!

This led me to [this book](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/DownldGF.html), which was a long and tiring read, yet arguably the most important layer of my solution.

Also, someone answered that if the $a$ s are positive integers, there is a straightfoward?! solution that involved generating functions.

He did give the realtion

$$[x^n]\prod_{i}(1-x^{a_i})^{-1}$$

I didn't understand it, for a pretty long time (I do now), and I kind gave up on the problem.

Don't really know why to this day, but I kept reading 'on the low'. Nothing too serious, just gave a short reading period from time to time, and also a bit of research.

It brings us now to our next topic!

# Burnside's lemma

> Consider a group $G$ that acts on a set $S$. If $\alpha \in G$ and $\text{fix} (\alpha)$ is the set of [fixed points](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Differential_Equations/Differential_Equations_(Chasnov)/08%3A_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations/8.01%3A_Fixed_Points_and_Stability) of $\alpha$, then 

> $$\lvert G \rvert \cdot \lvert S/G \rvert = \sum_{\alpha \in G} \lvert \text{fix}(\alpha) \rvert$$

The proof is also pretty immediate, you take the quant. $\sum_{\alpha \in G} \lvert \text{fix}(\alpha) \rvert$ which is just an enumeraetion of the ordered pairs  $(\alpha,x) \in G\times S$ for which $\alpha (x) = x$, then 

$$\sum_{\alpha \in G} \lvert \text{fix}(\alpha) \rvert = \lvert \{ (\alpha,x) \in G \times S | \alpha(x) = x \} \rvert = \sum_{x \in S} \lvert \text{stab}(x) \rvert = \sum_{H \in S/G} \sum_{x\in H} \lvert \text{stab}(x) \rvert$$

And the [orbit stabilizer theorem](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Orbit-Stabilizer_Theorem) yields that

$$\sum_{x\in H} \lvert \text{stab}(x) \rvert = \sum_{x\in H} \lvert \text{stab}(i) \rvert = \lvert \text{orb}(i) \rvert \cdot \lvert \text{stab}(i) \rvert = \lvert G \rvert $$

And thous 
$$\sum_{\alpha \in G} \lvert \text{fix}(\alpha) \rvert = \sum_{H \in S/G} \sum_{x\in H} \lvert \text{stab}(x) \rvert = \sum_{H \in S/G} \lvert G \rvert = \lvert G \rvert \cdot \lvert S/G \rvert$$

Which is the desired result.
