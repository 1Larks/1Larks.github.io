> Let $W(n, k)$ denote the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as the product of $k$ integers. For example, $W(144, 4) = 7$ because:

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 8 \times 9$

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 24$

> $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 6 \times 12$

> $144 = 1 \times 3 \times 4 \times 12$

> $144 = 1 \times 3 \times 6 \times 8$

> $144 = 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6$

> Furthermore, $W(100!,10)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007 = 287549200$. Find $W(10000!,30)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
